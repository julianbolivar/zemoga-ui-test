# Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test v2.1

### Overview

This project is made with React library in a stardard web. It doesnâ€™t have the structure created by 'create-react-app' so I use React to create only one part of the web. You need to follow the next instructions because the project uses Javascript as a module. If you open the "index.html" in your browser, you will see a CORS error in the console.

### Instructions

1. Open a terminal. (On Windows: `cmd`)
2. Type `npm` and hit Enter to see if Node.js is installed.
3. If you get `command not found`, download at https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install. (On Ubuntu, you can try `sudo apt install -y nodejs`.)
4. For Windows users only: do `cd /D "C:\Program Files\nodejs"`.
   By changing to that directory, the installed npm package will be reachable from anywhere - as long as `C:\Program Files\nodejs` is in your `%PATH%` environment variable.
5. Install live-server globally: npm install -g live-server.
6. Change the directory where your page lives `(Folder with the index.html)`: `cd <test-project-folder>`.
   (Should open localhost:8080 in your default browser)

**Nota:** You can also use Live Server plugin in VSCode to run the project
